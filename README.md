# School_Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to demonstrate React skill by buildilng a fully functional portfolio application. React makes coding a lot more enjoyable and using Bootstrap along side React makes it much easier. I enjoyed making my first React App and I am only expecting to improve from here. If it were not for a deadline I would have gladly spent more time into this to style it some more.
